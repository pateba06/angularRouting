# angularRouting

Hi All,

In this repo I am trying to make easy to learn for any one the concept of Routing, Eager Loading, Lazy Loading and Pre-laoding. 

#Guide How to use it. I am going to push every new concept with source code and details by branch name 
So see different branch name , I have also mentioned how to clone branch wise codes.

Happy Learning :)

Thanks,
Badal
